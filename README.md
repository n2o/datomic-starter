# datomic-starter

This project follows [datomic's tutorial](http://docs.datomic.com/get-datomic.html) to create a database and fill it with some data. I assume, that you have download datomic, put it into the project's root directory and rename it to `datomic`. Then you can use `./start_db.sh` to start the database.

The complete code is located in [src/datomic_starter/core.clj](https://github.com/n2o/datomic-starter/blob/master/src/datomic_starter/core.clj)
